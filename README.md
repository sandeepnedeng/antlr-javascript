# antlr-javascript

I have been learning Antlr from Terry's book, the book and code is well and good, I really liked the architecture and the multilanguage support, at work I had to do this in Javascript, I am no Javascript Guru, TBH I hate that, to my dismay there were not so many code samples to do this either, I Kind of had to dig into and build all scaffolding stuff, I am uploading this so that anyone begining to do javascript + antlr dont have to go through the horror that I had been through :)
